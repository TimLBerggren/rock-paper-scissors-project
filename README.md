# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Introduction
This project implements the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. It serves as an introduction for me to JavaScript programming, focusing on basic logic and functions.

## Problem Solving Approach
To build this project effectively I want to showcase my ability to:

- Plan or Pseudocode: Break down tasks into manageable steps.
- Code: Implement the planned solutions.
- Test: Verify functionality through console.log or browser tools.

##Assignment Overview
This project is structured into sequential steps:

1. Setup the Project Structure: Initialize a Git repository and link JavaScript externally.
2. Get the Computer Choice: Develop a function to randomly select "rock", "paper", or "scissors".
3. Get the Human Choice: Create a function for user input.
4. Score Tracking: Establish variables to track human and computer scores.
5. Play a Single Round: Write a function to compare choices and update scores.
6. Play the Entire Game: Construct a function to play 5 rounds and declare a winner.
